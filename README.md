# A-Geo---intelligent-Crop-Advisor-and-Market-Predictor-System-for-Farmers

This is our final year engineering project. Basically this project has two components:-

The first component focuses on developing a robust machine learning and deep learning model to recommend crops based on the analysis of soil images. By considering essential soil parameters such as pH, rainfall, and nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), in conjunction with geographical regions, our goal is to empower farmers with personalized and optimized crop recommendations.

Once the crop is predicted, the second component focuses on predicting the best suitable markets for selling those crops. By reducing the time farmers spend on market research, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the agricultural supply chain.
